Building an entire game in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) from scratch is not a trivial task. It requires a lot of time, effort, and a good machine to run the engine properly : ).

For the purpose of this project I will be using a pre-built project called [city park environment collection](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/city-park-environment-collection). This project is available for free on the Unreal Engine marketplace and provides a realistic 3D environment that resembles a city park.
